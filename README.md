# Paul Jason Mello - Personal Website

Hi I'm Paul Jason Mello, a PhD student at the University of Nevada, Reno, specializing in deep neural networks and artificial intelligence. My work focuses on optimizing and enhancing deep neural networks by combining generative modeling with statistical mechanics, applying information theory to mitigate biases and advance machine learning methodologies.


## About Me

### Academic Background


Education is the cornerstone of my sense of self. I began my academic career in 2016 studying computer science at California State University, Sacramento where I found an interest in machine learning, mathematics, and notably philosophy. Following my time at Sac State, in 2021, I entered my masters in artificial intelligence at San Jose State University where I studied the intersection of information theory, deep neural networks, and denoising diffusion probabilistic models under the guidance of the phenomenal mentor Dr. Stas Tiomkin. With my passion for artificial intelligence driving me, I began my doctorate in 2024 at the University of Nevada, Reno studying computer science and engineering under the supervision of Dr. Emily Hand. 


### Research Interests


My research interests are centered on the following areas:


- **Deep Neural Networks**: Exploring the fundamentals and advanced architectures of DNNs.

- **Generative Modeling**: Developing novel approaches to generate data with specific properties, such as privacy preservation and bias mitigation.

- **Information Theory**: Leveraging information-theoretic principles to enhance model performance and fairness.

- **Statistical Mechanics**: Applying concepts from statistical mechanics to understand and optimize the behavior of neural networks.

- **Grokking and B-Splines**: Investigating the phenomenon of grokking in neural networks and exploring the application of B-splines in AI models.


### Projects and Experience


Over the course of my academic career I have completed many projects I am proud of. Here are a few highlights:



- **Information Processing in Diffusion Processes (Master’s Thesis)**: Leveraged neural estimators and generative modeling to explore information flow in thermodynamic systems, discovering implicit biases in diffusion models.

- **Multi-Resolution Diffusion for Privacy-Sensitive Recommender Systems**: Co-authored a paper on a state-of-the-art latent diffusion architecture to synthesize privacy-preserving data, developing a novel score-based objective inspired by denoising score matching.

- **Amputee Rehabilitation Software (Capstone Project)**: Managed a team to develop software for personalized patient care, partnering with medical professionals to design a robust application for data collection and analysis.


### Skills


I work with the following languages, libraries, and tools:


- **Languages**: Python, R, C, C++, Shell, Java, Go, Ruby, SQL

- **Libraries**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, tinygrad, Jax, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NLTK, OpenCV


### Personal Interests


When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy biking, strategy games, and a good cup of chai.
